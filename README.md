# Novel Geometric-Programming Formulations  in Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits

Geometric programming is often used in the layout and timing problems of circuit design.
The gate sizing problem is perhaps the best known special case. To the best of our
knowledge, the literature has used either deterministic delay models or approximating
statistical models, so far. A significant part of the thesis includes the solution to finding
a multiplication of two numbers using only optimization variables that can then be used
in the SSTA algorithm. This thesis also presents two new solutions of the statistical
approach to the gate sizing problem using mixed-integer programming and geometric
programming. In particular, a histogram approximation of the statistical approach is
employed. We apply our proposed algorithms to the ISCAS benchmark circuit and
compare the results with the deterministic approach.
